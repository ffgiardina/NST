# Neural style transfer

Neural style transfer is a technique based on deep convolutional neural networks that applies the style of an image to a content image. Among many things, this allows one to take ones favorite pictures and reimagine them as a creation of one's favorite painter, or to, for example, reimagine how the Eiffel tower would look like if it were covered in leaves.

This contained jupyter notebook in this repository contains an accessible implementation of neural style transfer. By changing the content and style image paths  one can quickly set up a new case with custom images and see the generated image progress in the output.

Two images created with this notebook are shown below: Escherizing M.C. Escher, and leafifying the Eiffel tower.
